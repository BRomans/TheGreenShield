# TheGreenShield
The Green Shield is a revisited version of Space Invaders where the player can use a BCI to create a barrier and stop the alien invasion.
It has been developed using the Unicorn Unity interface for G.Tec Unicorn Hybrid Black and Unicorn Headband devices. It can be played as flatscreen version on a Windows PC or in VR version on Meta Quest.
