# TheGreenShield
The Green Shield is a revisited version of Space Invaders where the player can use a BCI to create a barrier and stop the alien invasion.
It has been developed using the Unicorn Unity interface for G.Tec Unicorn Hybrid Black and Unicorn Headband devices. It can be played as flatscreen version on a Windows PC or in VR version on Meta Quest.

## How to Play
1. **Download**: get the folder "TheGreenShield.zip" from the [release page](https://github.com/BRomans/TheGreenShield/releases) and run the executable.
2. **Get Set Up**: Connect your g.tec Unicorn device and ensure it's properly calibrated on your brain.
3. **Focus and Concentrate**: Use your mental focus on the Neurofeedback Targets to generate force shields.
5. **Score Points**: Keep your eye on the portals and stop as many alien drones as possible to score points.
